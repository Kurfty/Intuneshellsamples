## Welcome to the Microsoft Mac Admins Community landing page

This community is intended for Microsoft Mac and iOS admins that are deploying and managing Apple devices in a Microsoft 365 environment. The community is free and open to anyone. The community is built on Viva Engage. To access the Viva Engage community:

1. You must request access by e-Mailing [MacAdmins@Microsoft.com](mailto:MacAdmins@Microsoft.com)
2. You must send the e-Mail from your M365 account

If you are in doubt if your account is an M365 account or not, go to the [M365 Home Page](https://portal.office.com) and sign in with it. If you can sign in here, then your account will work with Viva Engage.

Requests are processed weekly, once you receive your invite e-Mail you should be able to access [the community](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIxMzY5NDcyMDQwOTYifQ).

Should you experience any issues, please reach out to [MacAdminsHelp@Microsoft.com](mailto:MacAdminsHelp@microsoft.com)

### Most common problems

1. [Didn't get a response] You didn't use an M365 account (resend request from your M365 account)
2. [You do not have access] Your organisation [blocks external Yammer / Viva Engage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/engage/work-with-external-users/disable-external-messaging#what-each-option-does) (Request that they enable it)
3. [Account Locked] Your M365 account registration in our directory has been disabled (e-Mail [MacAdminsHelp](mailto:MacAdminsHelp@microsof.com) and we'll get it reset)
4. [Conversations Aren't Loading Right Now] You're probably using the wrong network, click on the World icon in Viva Engage (top right) and select the Microsoft network.
